# DEMO Repo â€” Climate Action Clustering\n\nThis is a synthetic demo dataset and outputs because the execution environment could not fetch live OWID data due to network restrictions.\n\nFiles:\n- Notebook: ClimateAction_CountryClustering_Colab.ipynb (uses OWID live data when run in Colab)\n- DEMO Results: country_clusters_DEMO.csv\n- DEMO Pitchdeck: ClimateAction_PitchDeck_DEMO.pptx\n\nTo run with real data: open the notebook in Google Colab and execute all cells.\n
